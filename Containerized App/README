novnc_wireshark.sh makes a containerized noVNC with Wireshark on localhost:8080 that is connected to a new Docker Network, wireshark-net.
  It also creates a containerized caddy webserver that hosts the noVNC container.

clean.sh stops and removes the wireshark and caddy container. 


The files in the capstone folder can be modified to add additional apps or to replace Wireshark.
  Dockerfile:   to Download the application
  menu.xml:     to add the application on the left-click menu
  supervisord:  something about how apps are loaded in. (I don't know about how it works that well)

The files in the caddy folder are for the caddy webserver.
